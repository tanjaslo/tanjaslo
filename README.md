### Welcome to my GitHub page! 👋 

My name is Tanja.
About a year ago I have decided to change careers and become a Frontend Developer.
In January 2021 I started my intense study and practice.

My values:

🤓 Permanent learning and development.

💪 Self-growth and perseverance will lead to achievements.

🗝️ Communication is crucial.

⏳ It's never to late to start.

♥️ I am pretty sure that real success can be achieved only in the area that sparks genuine interest in you.
🥳 I’m a positive thinker and 🤝 reliable partner.

Thanks for taking the time to go over my summary and if you'd like to see some of my work check out my portfolio:
